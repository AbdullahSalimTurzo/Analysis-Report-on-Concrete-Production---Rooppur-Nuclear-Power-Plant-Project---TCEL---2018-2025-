# Concrete Production (2018-2025)
I led a comprehensive data analysis project on concrete production for the TCEL - Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant Project. The goal was to transforn unstructured laboratory data into actionable insights to support project management, quality control, and decision-making. 


**ðŸ“Š Key Insights**

_Production Volume:_ 41,500.55 mÂ³ of concrete cast from 2018â€“2025 (21.08.2025). Peak production in 2019 (9,629.36 mÂ³).

_ðŸ“œ Contract - Lot-Wise :_ Lot 1400 (35.25%) and Lot 16 (26.92%) were major contributors.

_ðŸ”¬Concrete Grades:_ B-25_W6 and B-25 had the highest volumes.

_Effective Casting Days:_ 2,109 days tracked with Pour Card documentation.

**ðŸ›  Tools & Methods**

Data Preparation: Microsoft Excel (primary formatting) + Power Query (advanced data sorting, unpivoting, cleaning, merging)

Statistical Analysis: Google Sheets (pivot tables, deviation analysis)

Visualization: Tableau (advanced breakdown, visualisation) + Power BI (DAX Calculation, bar charts, pie charts, histograms)

</p>

**ðŸ“ˆ This project demonstrates my ability to handle large datasets, perform statistical analysis, and create clear visualizations to support complex engineering projects.**
